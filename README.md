This project report details the development of a comprehensive system designed using Java Swing, aimed at providing a multi-faceted platform for efficient data management and manipulation.
At its forefront is an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), featuring a startup window with a school-themed background and a central 'Launch' button that leads users to the main functional area of the application.
This area is organized into three distinct tabs, each representing a unique functionality: the first tab facilitates the import and display of data from .xlsx files in a JTable, allowing for user-driven data modification and log output;  the second tab centers around CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling users to interact with text files in a database folder through add, delete, and modify buttons, accompanied by a logging feature;  the third tab offers a specialized query functionality, where users can select and input information for various categories like ‘Hardware’, ‘Item’, or ‘Value’, triggering a search that displays relevant data and logs.  Designed to tackle challenges in data processing and user interface design, the project exemplifies a blend of technical prowess and user-centric development, catering to both functional robustness and ease of use.
